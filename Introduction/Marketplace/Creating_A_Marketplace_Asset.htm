  <h1>Creating A Marketplace Asset</h1>
  <p>When you select the <strong>Create Package</strong> option from the IDE <a href="../../IDE_Navigation/Menus/The_Marketplace_Menu.htm">Marketplace Menu</a> you will be taken to the following workspace:<img alt="Marketplace Create Package" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_Marketplace_CreatePackage.png"/> <span style="display: none;"> </span> <span class="droptext" data-targetname="drop_down4"> <span class="dropspot">Here</span></span> you must first select the Publisher
    identity that you want to publish the asset package as (which you should have set up from your <a href="Creating_A_Publisher_Account.htm">Publisher Dashboard</a>), then give a <strong>Display Name</strong> and a <a class="tooltip" title="A version number is a unique set of numbers assigned to a specific release of a software program, game or asset, normally with the format MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE, eg: v2.3.56. Typically, as updates and entirely new editions of a game or asset are released, the version number will increase.">Version Number</a>. A package ID will then be created for you based on the display name and publisher account used, but you can edit this to be something else if you wish as long as it maintains the reverse URL format. You then need to choose
    the type of asset package to make:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>Asset</strong>: This is a collection of assets (sprites, scripts, objects, etc...) that you wish to sell on the Marketplace</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>Demo</strong>: This is a demo to demonstrate some concept or game idea</li>
    <li class="dropspot"><strong>Tutorial</strong>: The asset being uploaded is a tutorial, designed to be run from within the GameMaker Studio 2 IDE (see <a href="Creating_A_Tutorial.htm">this page</a> for more details)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have done that you can then choose which assets from the project you want to add into the Asset Package using the section on the right. You can add all your assets, or only some of them as well as remove any that you may have added by mistake.
    It is assumed that you have created the asset to be uploaded previously in GameMaker Studio 2 and that the current project contains all that you require to upload.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>REMEMBER!</strong> To be able to create or use asset packages, you must have previously created a user profile certificate. You can do this from the Marketplace Preferences, which is explained <a href="../../Setting_Up_And_Version_Information/IDE_Preferences/Marketplace_Preferences.htm">here</a>.</p>
  <p>When you are happy with the selection of assets and want to upload your package to the Marketplace, simply click the <em>Okay</em> button at the bottom, and the asset package will be created and uploaded to the Marketplace. When the upload is complete,
    a new workspace will open with a browser view of the asset page for you to edit. For more information on how to set this up, please see the following page:</p>
  <ul class="colour">
    <li><a href="Listing_An_Asset.htm">Listing An Asset</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you need to update a Marketplace Asset, you do more or less the same as you did when you created the original package, only now you need to specify the package to update from a drop down list of available packages:</p>
  <p><img alt="Update Asset List Of Assets" class="center" src="../../assets/Images/Introduction/Tools_Marketplace_UpdateAsset.png"/>When updating, you won&#39;t be able to change the package ID, and you should be aware that the <a class="tooltip" title="A version number is a unique set of numbers assigned to a specific release of a software program, game or asset, normally with the format MAJOR.MINOR.MAINTENANCE, eg: v2.3.56. Typically, as updates and entirely new editions of a game or asset are released, the version number will increase.">Version Number</a> shown will be the <em>current </em>version number and you <strong>should increment this as appropriate</strong> otherwise the update will fail (since you cannot have two asset packages with the same version number). There
    is also a field where you can add some text for the change log for the asset, and this will be uploaded along with the asset and dislpayed on the Marketplace page. </p>
